Don't forget to set up a .env.json file like the following :

{"sender":"senderMail",
"password":"passwordToUseEmailInApps"}

(I know i can do a .env file but i was drunk while doing that so please just judge a little).

After mails have been sent (or not if error), you'll have some generated logs here :
